# Deep Convolutional GAN with PyTorch

Original paper: [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)

In a few words, DCGAN is very similar to vanilla GAN, but contains Convolutional layers, which is made more suitable to extract important features from the pictures.

## How to run this code?

You can simply run this with

```python
python main.py
```

All settings and gyperparameters are stored in `config.toml` file
